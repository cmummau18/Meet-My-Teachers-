  <h2>Course Description:</h2>
<p>In this class we are studying the development of the media and its implications on society.
  We are looking into censored books, social media mayhem, the Beatles, cultural issues influencing media across the globe, public relations campaigns,
  video game madness, and the immortal Charlie Chaplain.
  We have even looked into diversity issues in the media such as gender and race.
  This course has helped me understand the implications of the media that encompasses our lives.
  We also talked about the history of media institutions and contemporary issues in the media.
  A few scandals in the media world popped up in class that we went in-depth talking about.</p>
