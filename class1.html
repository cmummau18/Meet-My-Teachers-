<h2>Course Description:</h2>
<p>This class introduced me to some of the various cultures and civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean
  world, which focused primarily upon Greece and Rome. It concentrates on the history, arts, culture and religion of Greece, Rome, and the Hellenistic world.
  I studied various material and intellectual encounters among diverse groups which occurred. It offered a broad overview of the Classical Mediterranean world and the cultures and civilizations which grew there.
  This course also highlighted the diverse encounters that occurred in that period and emphasized the synthesis of ideas that
  emerged out of antiquity.</p>
  <h2>Research Interests:</h2>
<p>Ms. Steer has expertise in Latin and Ancient History. She enjoys going back overseas where she went to college at Cambridge Univeristy to learn more about the cultures
  surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. No research that she has done is public but from what she has talked about in class, her favorite research
  that she has done is on the Seven Kings of Rome. Rome and Greece are her babies and that's the majority of what this class is prefaced on. She has
  researched the two of these empires at length and I would assume this is what the majority of her research is on.</p>
