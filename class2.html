<h2>Education:</h2>
<ul><li>None Listed</li></ul>

<h2>Course Description:</h2>
<p>The reason for taking this course was to familiarize myself with the advising tools in the Department of Communication
(such as the Advising Center, Graduation Worksheets, DARS, and Pathway Planner) and the comm.-associated curricular,
co-curricular, and extra-curricular resources available to me on the VT campus
(including the VT Library and Career Services Office). This allowed me to meet new people in the communications department that will help
me schedule classes in the future. Scout has been a huge help and I couldn't have asked for a better advisor to start my time off
in the department.</p>
<h2>Research Interests:</h2>
<p>Ms. Stinson doesn't have any public research either. That is because she is an advisor in the COMM department, not a professor. She is the instructor
for this class because a lot of it is logistical items that you need to know once you transfer into the department. She is classified as a new student coordinator
and she is great at that. </p>
<h2>Professional Activities/Groups:</h2>
<p>Nothing was listed on her bio on the CLAHS website. Again this is because she isn't technically a professor.</p></main>
