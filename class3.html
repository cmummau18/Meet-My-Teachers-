<h1>Housing & The Consumer</h1>
<h2>Online</h2>
<br>
  <h2>Professor:</h2><h3><u>Janet Wimmer</u></h3>
<p>She told us at the start of the course that she likes to live <i>off the grid</i> so there is no photo of her on the internet.</p>
<h2>Education:</h2>
<ul><li>None Listed</li></ul>

<h2>Course Description:</h2>
<p>In this housing course we learned an introduction to the many aspects of residential housing. This
  course is going to be beneficial to me when I get out into the real world.
  We learned a lot about mortgages and how to calculate how much you can afford to pay for housing.
  Also, we learned about different architectural styles of homes and the pros & cons of each.
  The information we covered may fit into both my professional career as well as my personal
life in the near future. This is the last class that I have to take in order to fulfill my Property Management Minor. </p>
<h2>Research Interests:</h2>
<p>Ms. Wimmer is a teacher in the AHRM department here at Virginia Tech. Her research is in textiles and how they have evolved over the years. She just
  oversees this housing course, but her real passion is in fashion. She's been a teacher both at Virginia Tech and at Radford. A lot of her personal life is not published because she likes to live
  <i>off the grid</i>.
  <h2>Proffesional Activities/Groups:</h2>
  <p> Like Ms. Stinson, Ms. Wimmer is employed by the university with the title of Sr. Laboratory specialist. She isn't technically a professor so she doesn't have
    any professional designations. She does do research for the University but she only teaches one or two classes per semester.</p></main>
