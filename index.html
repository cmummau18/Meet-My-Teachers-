     <h2>Introduction:</h2>
     <p>Being a new COMM student this semester has been a blast! I was a little nervous going in because I didn't know what to expect of the major or the professors.
       The curriculum hasn't been too stressful but it definitely has pushed me to think outside of the box. My Intro to COMM Research class has made me think back to statistics in high
       school to remember certain algorithms in order to figure out tendencies. My Visual Media class has exposed me to programs that I didn't even know existed. Yes the Lynda.com
       tutorials were annoying to watch, but I learned a ton. Also, would have never been using Atom like I am right now! This is the program that I used to code this website.
       Even my Media & Society class has taught me a lot about how the media is able to sway
        opinions on various topics by just changing the title of a headling. COMM is completely different than Real Estate, but it has opened my eyes and made me realize that for
        my first two years here I was in the wrong major.
